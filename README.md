# MovieTrends
----
Project to analyse the daily movie trends from the website [The Movie DataBase](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
The main idea is upload the results to a PostgreSQL server and check the results monthly, however, we can download the results in a JSON file.

The files contained are:
+ CSV file with the movie genres.
+ CSV file with the movie details.
+ CSV file with the relation between movies and the trend day.
+ Jupyter Notebook with an example of analysis.
+ Python files to download the trends, upload the trends to the server from file and download and upload the results.
